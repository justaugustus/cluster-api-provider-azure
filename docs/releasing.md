# Release Process

1. Create a draft release in github
2. Tag the repository and push the tag
   - An [OWNER](/OWNERS) runs `git tag -s $VERSION` and inserts the changelog and pushes the tag with `git push $VERSION`
3. Run `make release-binaries`
4. Attach the tarball to the drafted release
5. Attach `clusterctl` to the drafted release (for darwin and linux architectures)
6. Write the release notes (see note below on release notes)
7. Build and push the container image
8. Publish release
9. Announce the release

## Versioning

cluster-api-provider-azure follows the [semantic versionining][semver] specification.

As of this writing, we have not produced as a major or minor release. 

Current pre-release versions can be expected to have breaking changes as we move towards declaring a public API version.

Example versions:
- Pre-release: `v0.1.0-alpha.4`
- Minor release: `v0.1.0`
- Patch release: `v0.1.1`
- Major release: `v1.0.0`

## Expected artifacts

1. A container image containing the azure-provider manager binary
2. A release tarball containing the manifest-templates and a script to generate        the actual manifests
3. `clusterctl`
4. Release notes

## Output locations

### Container image

The container image will live in the registry `quay.io/k8s/cluster-api-provider-azure`
under the image name `cluster-api-azure-controller:<tag>` where `<tag>` is
replaced by the version being released.

### Manifests

Manifests must be generated by hand.

Running `make release-binaries` will create a tarball that you can attach to
the drafted release.

### Binaries

The binary produced by a release is the `clusterctl` binary. There should be support for both darwin and linux architectures.

### Release Notes

Release notes are written by hand. Generally, we'll make a [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/)
and share the release note responsibility for a few days in advance of the
release.

The markdown is shared in the kubernetes slack in the channel #cluster-api-azure.

## Communication

### Pre-releases

1. Announce the release in Kubernetes Slack on the #cluster-api-azure channel.

### Official releases

1. Follow the communications process for [pre-releases](#pre-releases)
2. An announcement email is sent to `kubernetes-sig-azure@googlegroups.com` and `kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle@googlegroups.com` with the subject `[ANNOUNCE] cluster-api-provider-azure $VERSION is released`
